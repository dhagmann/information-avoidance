<!-- Self Avoidance Option -->
{% if player.treatment == "self" %}
In this round, you have chosen to invest a total of {{player.investment}} tokens in Option {{player.chosen_option}}. You now have the option to find out how much you could have earned if you had instead invested {{player.investment}} tokens in Option {% if player.chosen_option == "A" %}B{% else %}A{% endif %}. Recall that the outcomes of these two options are independent, so if the investment did not pay off with one option, it could still have paid off with the other option.</br></br>

Would you like to see how much you could have earned, if you had chosen differently?
